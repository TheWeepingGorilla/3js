Just wanted to add that the "run a webserver" answer seems quite daunting, but if you have python on your system (installed by default at least on MacOS and any Linux distribution) it's as easy as:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
So if you have your html file myfile.html in a folder, say mydir, all you have to do is:

cd /path/to/mydir
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
Then point your browser to:

http://localhost:8000/myfile.html
And you are done! Works on all browsers, without disabling web security, allowing local files, or even restarting the browser with command line options.
